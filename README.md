Following is my college 655 C# Final Project
# 655 Final Project using MultiThreading

#CLIENT/SERVER APPLICATION
Use Visual C#.NET to design a client/server application (i.e., a server program and a client program), which could be either a Windows Forms Application or a Console Application of your choice. Your application could be, for example, a game, a business application, such as simple banking operations, task scheduler, a file and/or data sharing and transfer application, etc. Please note that the server could serve multiple clients. It is required to use multithreading in your program. It is also required to include all necessary error-checking and error-handling techniques to prevent run-time errors.
